    <h4>
        <p>
            I am a highly driven undergraduate student at Ahmedabad University's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, planning to major in Computer Science and Engineering. I consider myself as an app developer and a data enthusiast. I would love to explore more in-depth areas, such as working with massive data sets and statistical analysis of data, as it will allow me to challenge myself in new and creative ways. I seek to continually build upon my skills and expand my knowledge in both these fields. With meticulous attention to detail, I endeavor to maintain precision and consistency in job completion, individual performance, and teamwork. I can provide creative thinking, planning, and schedule flexibility. I consider myself proficient in the field of Developing Apps and its Structures and Data Analysis.
